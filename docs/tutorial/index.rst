Tutorial walkthrough
********************************************************************************

Having outlined on the :ref:`previous page <TheOverview>` some of the
big-picture story---how :obj:`meep_adjoint` fits into the larger
design-optimization ecosystem, and what you can expect to put into and
get out of a typical session---on this page we get down to details.
We will present a step-by-step walkthrough of a :obj:`meep_adjoint` session
that, starting from scratch, automagically finds intricate and *highly*
non-intuitive device designs whose performance far exceeds anything we
could hope to design by hand.


======================================================================
The problem: optimal routing of optical power flows
======================================================================

The engineering problem we will be considering is the design of
*interconnect router* devices for optical networks. For our purposes,
a router is a hunk of lossless dielectric material, confined within
a rectangular (2D) or box-shaped (3D) region of given fixed dimensions,
from which emanate four stub waveguides (of given fixed sizes and materials)
representing I/O ports, which we label simply **East**, **West**, **North**, and
**South**.

The router will live inside an optical-network switch with
each port connected to a fiber-optic cable carrying incoming and outgoing
signals, and our job is to design the central hub to ensure that signals
arriving on some given set of input ports are routed to some given set
of output ports with optimality according to some given set of
desiderata. Evidently, different choices of input and output ports
and performance criteria yield different optimization problems, and we will
show how this freedom is reflected in the :obj:`meep_adjoint` API and
our python driver scripts. For most this tutorial, we will focus
on two particular design tasks:


    * **Right-angle router:** Steer incoming signals arriving on the **West**
      port through a 90-degree bend to depart via the **North** port.
      Here the design objective is simply to maximize transfer of signal
      power from input to output, minimizing losses due to leakage power
      emissions from the  **South** or **East** ports.


    * **Three-way splitter:** Split an input signal arriving on the **West**
      port into three equal-power output signals departing via the
      **North**, **South,** and **East** ports. For this task
      we will suppose that the design objective is not maximum
      output power, but rather maximal *uniformity* of power
      emissions from the three output ports.

======================================================================
The phases of a :obj:`meep_adjoint` session and the structure of this tutorial
======================================================================

This tutorial consists of three parts, corresponding to the three
stages of a typical :obj:`meep_adjoint` session:


    .. glossary::


        :ref:`1. Initialization <Phase1>`: *Defining the problem and initializing the solver*


           The first step is to identify all of the
           :ref:`ingredients needed to define our design-optimization problem <OptProbIngredients>`
           and communicate them to :obj:`meep_adjoint` in the form of
           arguments passed to the :class:`OptimizationProblem` constructor.
           The class instance we get back will furnish the
           portal through which we access :obj:`meep_adjoint` functionality
           and the database that tracks the evolution of our design
           and its performance.

           The initialization phase also typically involves setting appropriate
           customized values for the many :doc:`configuration options </customization/index>`
           affecting the behavior of :obj:`meep_adjoint`.

           |br|



        :ref:`2. Interactive exploration <Phase2>`: *Single-point calculations and visualization*

           Before initiating a lengthy, opaque machine-driven
           design iteration, we will first do some *human*-driven
           poking and prodding to kick the tires of our
           :class:`OptimizationProblem`---both to make sure we defined the
           problem correctly, and also to get a feel for how challenging
           it seems, which will inform our choice of convergence criteria
           and other parameter settings for the automated phase.
           More specifically, in this phase we will invoke
           :obj:`meep_adjoint` API routines to do the following:


               A. update the design function :math:`\epsilon^\text{des}(\mathbf{x})`---that is,
                  move to a new point :math:`\boldsymbol{\beta}`
                  in design space

               B. numerically evaluate the objective-function value :math:`f^\text{obj}(\boldsymbol{\beta})`
                  at the current design point

               C. numerically evaluate the objective-function *gradient* :math:`\boldsymbol{\nabla} f^\text{obj}`
                  at the current design point


               D. produce graphical visualizations of both the device geometry---showing
                  the spatially-varying permittivity distribution of the current design---and
                  the results of the :codename:`meep` calculations of the previous two
                  items, showing the spatial configuration of electromagnetic fields produced
                  by the current iteration of the device design.


           Because steps B, C, and D here are executed with the device design held fixed
           at a single point in design space, we refer to them as static or *single-point*
           operations, to be distinguished from the dynamic multi-point trajectory through
           design space traversed by the automated design optimization of the following stage.

           Of course, of all the single-point tests we might run in our interactive investigation,
           perhaps the most useful is

               E. *check* the adjoint calculation of step C above
                  by slightly displacing the design point in the direction
                  of the gradient reported by :obj:`meep_adjoint` and
                  confirming that this does, in fact, improve the value
                  of the objective function---that is, compute
                  :math:`f^\text{obj}\Big(\boldsymbol{\beta} + \alpha\boldsymbol{\nabla} f\Big)`
                  (with :math:`\alpha\sim 10^{-2}` a small scalar value)
                  and verify that it is an improvement over the result of step B above.


           |br|


        :ref:`3. Automation <Phase3>`: *Machine-driven iterative design optimization*

           Once we've confirmed that our problem setup is correct
           and acquired some feel for how it behaves in practice,
           we'll be ready to hand it off to a numerical optimizer
           and hope for the best. As we will demonstrate, the easiest way
           to proceed here is
           to invoke the simple built-in gradient-descent optimizer
           provided by :obj:`meep_adjoint`---which, we will see, is
           more than adequate to yield excellent results for the
           specific problems addressed in this tutorial---but we will also
           show how, with only slightly more effort, you can
           use your favorite external gradient-based optimization package
           instead.


.. _Phase1:

==================================================
Phase 1: Problem definition and initialization: |br| Creating an :class:`OptimizationProblem`
==================================================

The first step in every `meep_adjoint` workflow is
to create an instance of :class:`OptimizationProblem<meep_adjoint.OptimizationProblem>`.
This class plays for :obj:`meep_adjoint` a role
analogous to that of the |simulation| class in the core |pymeep|:
its public methods offer access to the computational
capabilities of the solver, and its internal data fields
keep track of all data and state needed to track the
progress of a computational session.


The :class:`OptimizationProblem<meep_adjoint.OptimizationProblem>` constructor accepts a
large number of required and optional input arguments, whose setup
will typically occupy a straightforward but somewhat lengthy chunk
of your driver script. You will find detailed auto-generated documentation
for the full set of arguments in the :doc:`API reference </API/HighLevel>`,
but in most cases you'll probably be able simply to copy the initialization 
code from :mod:`router.py` or one of the other
:doc:`worked examples </example_gallery/index>` and modify as appropriate
for your problem.

The :ref:`next section <constructor_quick_reference>`
offers a quick list of the most important
constructor arguments (again deferring the exhaustive documentation
to the :doc:`API reference </API/HighLevel>`), and the
:ref:`following section <router_py_walkthrough>` illustrates
their use in practice via an annotated walkthrough
of the :mod:`router.py` initialization code.

Roughly speaking, the inputs needed to instantiate an
:class:`OptimizationProblem<meep_adjoint.OptimizationProblem>`
may be grouped into three categories (click the title headers below

           List of |MeepGeometricObject| structures describing material
           bodies in the geometry, *not* including the design region,
           for which :mod:`meep_adjoint` automatically creates an
           appropriate object internally. The "background" and "foreground"
           lists contain objects that logically lie "beneath" and "above"
           the design region; internally, these lists are concatenated,
           with the automatically-created design object in between,
           to form the list of objects passed as the `geometry` input
           to the |simulation| constructor

           This is a convenience argument that may be used instead of
           `sources` for problems with only a single excitation source.
           If present, `source_region` should be a 
           :class:`Subregion <meep_adjoint.dft_cell.Subregion>`
           (or a |MeepVolume|) specifying the spatial extent of
           the source, which :obj:`meep_adjoint` will use together
           with the values of 
           :doc:`configuration options</customization/index>` [#f2]_
           to construct a single-element list passed as the
           `sources` parameter to the |simulation| constructor.

            structures for all objective region. (A `Subregion`

            except that each `Subregion` has a unique *name*,

.. _router_py_walkthrough:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Annotated walkthrough of `router.py` initialization and setup code
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In :mod:`router.py,` the setup and initialization code lives
in a function called `init_problem`, which accepts no arguments
and returns a new instance of 
:class:`OptimizationProblem <meep_adjoint.OptimizationProblem>`,
referring both to `router.py`-specific command-line arguments
and `meep_adjoint`-wide
:doc:`configuration options </configuration/index>`
for various pieces of information. What follows is a detailed
walk through this routine with a blow-by-blow analysis of the
various initialization tasks it handles.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1A. Fetch values for global (`meep-adjoint`-wide) and local (script-specific) and configurable options 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. ############################################################
.. ############################################################
.. ############################################################
Like most `meep_adjoint` driver scripts, `router.py` makes use
of user-configured settings for both 
general-purpose (problem-independent)
:doc:`configuration options </configuration/index>`
defined by `meep_adjoint`
and problem-specific options defined by `router.py`.

Examples of the former include the options `fcen`
(center frequency of forward sources), `dpml` (thickness
of PML layers), and `dair` (thickness of air gaps between
material bodies and PML layers)
In lines 37-39 below we query `meep_adjoint` for its
current values of those options (note that `adj_opt` is
short for `meep_adjoint.get_adjoint_option`).

Just before this, in lines 33-36, we call `set_option_defaults`
to update some of the hard-coded default option values in 
`meep_adjoint` to values that make more sense for the router
problem. Note that this step only affects the *default* option
settings, which are still overridden by command-line arguments
or configuration files. For more on this, see the
:doc:`configuration section </configuration/index>` of this
documentation tree.

.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 6

        import meep as mp
        import meep_adjoint
        from meep_adjoint import get_adjoint_option as adj_opt
        from meep_adjoint import get_visualization_option as vis_opt

        from meep_adjoint import ( OptimizationProblem, Subregion,
                                   ORIGIN, XHAT, YHAT, ZHAT, E_CPTS, H_CPTS, v3, V3)

                None (reads command-line options from sys.argv).

            Returns:

            """

            ######################################################################
            # set custom defaults for meep_adjoint package-wide options, then
            # fetch values for a few such options we will need in this routine
            ######################################################################
            meep_adjoint.set_option_defaults( { 'fcen': 0.5, 'df': 0.2,
                                                'dpml': 1.0, 'dair': 0.5,
                                                'eps_design': 6.0

            dpml = adj_opt('dpml')
            dair = adj_opt('dair')



Then (lines 45-71) we follow the usual `argparse` procedure to
define a number of options specific to the router geometry---such 
as the widths or permittivity of the waveguides---and parse
`router.py` command-line arguments for their settings.


.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 45

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

    # options affecting the geometry of the router
    parser.add_argument('--w_east',   type=float, default=1.5,  help='width of EAST waveguide stub')
    parser.add_argument('--w_west',   type=float, default=1.5,  help='width of WEST waveguide stub')
    parser.add_argument('--w_north',  type=float, default=1.5,  help='width of NORTH waveguide stub')
    parser.add_argument('--w_south',  type=float, default=1.5,  help='width of SOUTH waveguide stub')
    parser.add_argument('--l_stub',   type=float, default=3.0,  help='waveguide stub length')
    parser.add_argument('--l_design', type=float, default=4.0,  help='design region side length')
    parser.add_argument('--h',        type=float, default=0.0,  help='thickness in z-direction')
    parser.add_argument('--eps_wvg',  type=float, default=6.0,  help='waveguide permittivity')

    # options affecting the type of device to design
    parser.add_argument('--splitter', action='store_true', help='design equal splitter instead of right-angle router')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    w_east   = args.w_east
    w_west   = args.w_west
    w_north  = args.w_north
    w_south  = args.w_south
    l_stub   = args.l_stub
    l_design = args.l_design
    h        = args.h
    eps_wvg  = args.eps_wvg
    splitter = args.splitter


.. admonition:: Mining command-line options for global and local options

    Note that the command-line options to `router.py` may be used to specify
    values for both `meep_adjoint` options (like `fcen`) and for
    `router.py` options (like `w_south`). How do the two sets of options,
    parsed at different times by separate parsers in distinct modules,
    coexist on the `router.py` command line?

    Answer: `meep_adjoint` takes a first crack at `sys.argv`, handling and removing
    all arguments it understands, and leaving arguments it doesn't recognize 
    untouched in their original sequence within `sys.argv`. (It uses
    `Argparser.parse_known_args` instead of `parse_args`)
    This happens when
    `meep_adjoint` initializes its databases of user-configurable options,
    which it does on a just-in-time basis the first time an option value is queried;
    in the present case, that happens on line 36, well before `router.py` takes
    its own crack at `sys.argv` (on line 60).

    One difference between `meep_adjoint` configuration options and `router.py`
    commmand-line options is that the former may also be set in configuration files.
    See the :doc:`customization section of this documentation </customization/index>`
    for more information.


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1B. Set up the computational cell and the fixed geometry
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The next steps are standard initialization procedures familiar to anyone
who has ever initialized a |simulation|. First we do a little arithmetic
to compute the dimensions of the computational cell based on the current
values of user-configurable geometric parameters like
``design_length`` (the side length of the central square hub region we are
trying to design) and ``dpml`` (thickness of PML layers):

.. code-block:: python
   :lineno-start: 81

   lcen          = 1.0/fcen
   dpml          = 0.5*lcen if dpml==-1.0 else dpml
   design_length = args.l_design
   sx = sy       = dpml + l_stub + design_length + l_stub + dpml
   sz            = 0.0 if h==0.0 else dpml + dair + h + dair + dpml
   cell_size     = [sx, sy, sz]


.. _SpecificVsPackageWide:


   .. admonition:: Problem-specific vs. package-wide configuration options

         Note that some of the user-configurable geometric parameters we
         reference here---such as ``design_length`` and ``l_stub`` (length
         of stub waveguide sections)---are ``router.py``-specific command-line options,
         while others---such as ``dpml`` and ``dair`` (length of air gaps
         between device outer perimeter and PML layers) are ``meep_adjoint``
         configuration options. This is not because PML thicknesses or air gaps
         play particularly special roles in adjoint calculations, but simply
         because pretty much every conceivable FDTD project will
         want to define user-configurable options for these quantities, so
         ``meep_adjoint`` just defines them once and for all at the package
         level, obviating the need for users to define e.g. a ``dpml`` parameter
         in every ``meep_adjoint`` script they write.
         

Next we construct a list of |MeepGeometricObject| structures to describe the fixed
portion of the material geometry---that is, everything except for the design region
in which we are allowed to tweak the permittivity
This is just like the list of objects
one constructs and passes as the ``geometry`` parameter to the |simulation|
constructor in the core |pymeep|, **except** that in forming this list we need only
account for material bodies lying *outside* the design region;
the material geometry *inside* the design region is handled entirely
internally within `meep_adjoint`, and our only responsibility is to
tell the `OptimizationProblem` constructor where the design region **is**
via the `design_region` parameter (see below). 

For the router problem, the design region is the square-shaped region
outlined by the dashed green line in the figure above, and the fixed material
geometry consists of just the four waveguide stubs emanating from it:

.. code-block:: python

   #----------------------------------------------------------------------
   #- geometric objects (material bodies), not including the design object
   #----------------------------------------------------------------------
   wvg_mat    = mp.Medium(epsilon=eps_wvg)
   east_wvg   = mp.Block(center=V3(ORIGIN+0.25*sx*XHAT), material=wvg_mat, size=V3(0.5*sx, w_east,  h) )
   west_wvg   = mp.Block(center=V3(ORIGIN-0.25*sx*XHAT), material=wvg_mat, size=V3(0.5*sx, w_west,  h) )
   north_wvg  = mp.Block(center=V3(ORIGIN+0.25*sy*YHAT), material=wvg_mat, size=V3(w_north, 0.5*sy, h) )
   south_wvg  = mp.Block(center=V3(ORIGIN-0.25*sy*YHAT), material=wvg_mat, size=V3(w_south, 0.5*sy, h) )

   background_geometry = [ east_wvg, west_wvg, north_wvg, south_wvg ]


We will pass this list as the `background_geometry` parameter to the `OptimizationProblem`
constructor.


    .. admonition:: Background and foreground geometries

        The label `background_geometry` for this list of objects refers to the fact that,
        in the full list of `geometric_object` structures that eventually gets
        passed to |meep|, they *precede* (lie beneath) the object describing the design region; thus, any portions of these objects that extend into the design region 
        are covered by the design object and don't show up in the computational
        geometry.
        For geometries in which portions of the fixed geometry lie logically
        *above* the design object, the optional constructor argument
        `foreground_geometry` may be used to specify a list of `geometric_objects`
        to come after the design-region object in the global list.

1C. Delineate functional subregions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Next we will delineate various subregions of the computational cell as being of particular significance.
Again, this step will be familiar to anyone who has ever defined a
|MeepFluxRegion| (or |MeepFieldRegion| or |MeepForceRegion| or
|MeepEnergyRegion| or |MeepModeRegion| or ...) with the slight twist that
the full panoply of distinct, specialized data structures for spatial regions
in core |meep| (which includes the five just mentioned, plus some others)
is replaced in ``meep_adjoint`` by the single new class
:class:`Subregion <meep_adjoint.Subregion>`. 

    .. admonition:: Subregions in :mod:`meep_adjoint`

      A *subregion* in `meep_adjoint` is simply
      a hyperrectangular region of space lying within the boundaries of
      the FDTD grid. A subregion may be of codimension 1 (i.e. a line in a 2D
      geometry or a plane in a 3D geometry), in which case it has a well-defined
      normal direction. Alternatively, subregions may be of codimension 0 [i.e.
      have the full dimensionality of the ambient space: a rectangle (2D) or box (3D)]
      or of dimension 0 (i.e. a set of discrete spatial points); in these cases the
      normal direction is undefined.
      Whereas the core |meep| solver treats each of these possibilities as distinct
      entities described by separate data structures---and further differentiates
      even among subregions of identical dimensionality based on the purpose for
      which the subregion is used in an FDTD calculation---`meep_adjoint` considers
      spatial regions of all (co-)dimensionalities and functional significance
      to be subcases of a common general entity, described by the single
      python class :class:`Subregion <meep_adjoint.Subregion>`.
      
      A further distinction is that each :class:`Subregion <meep_adjoint.Subregion>`.
      in `meep_adjoint` has a *name*---a unique character-string identifier
      that may be chosen arbitrarily by users, or is assigned automatically
      if left unspecified. (The assignment of unique names to subregions is 
      something that would probably be fairly useful even in core |meep|, but
      is essential in `meep_adjoint` to yield a :ref:`natural, canonical naming
      convention for physical quantities like Poynting fluxes and energy densities
      <defining_the_objective_function>`)

      Notwithstanding these differences, the instantiation of `Subregions`
      is syntactically almost identical
      to the instantiation of e.g. |MeepFluxRegion| or |MeepFieldRegion|
      structures in core |meep| scripts, as the examples below illustrate.


The initialization phase of a typical  `meep_adjoint` problem
involves defining three distinct functional categories of
`Subregion`: source regions, objective regions, and the design
region. The first two of these will be familiar to anyone who has ever
created a |Simulation|, while the third is optimization-specific
and has no analogue in core |meep|. (As an optional fourth category,
you can also provide a list of "extra" subregions belonging to none
of the above categories).


    .. glossary::


        1. `source_region`: Location of excitation sources

            When creating an `OptimizationProblem` for a simulation model in
            which the FDTD excitation source is relatively simple---namely,
            a single |MeepEigenmodeSource| or constant-amplitude volume source 
            confined to a single `Subregion`---it suffices to pass that
            `Subregion` as the `source_region` constructor parameter;
            then it will be used, together with package-wide configuration options 
            like `fcen` and `source_component` or `source_mode`, internally
            within `meep_adjoint` to construct appropriate |MeepSource| structures
            for forward FDTD simulations.        


    
            .. admonition:: `source_region` is a convenience shortcut for `sources`

                    The use of `source_region` together with global configuration variables
                    to define sources is actually a convenience option provided as a
                    shortcut for simple source configurations.[#f3]_
                    The more general way to define forward sources for your problem is
                    to instantiate a list of `MeepSource` structures and pass it as the
                    `sources` parameter to the `OptimizationProblem` constructor, in
                    which case you would `not` specify `source_region`.
                   

        2. `objective_regions`: *Declaring sites at which we want frequency-domain fields and associated physical quantities*

           Next we specify all the subregions over which we will ask the FDTD solver to tabulate
           frequency-domain fields. This is another step that will be familiar to anybody who has
           ever written a core |meep| script, but again with slightly different (simpler!) mechanics. In a core
           |meep| script, for each subregion of interest we would execute a two-step procedure:


               1. We would first define the subregion of interest by creating a |MeepFluxRegion| or |MeepFieldRegion|
                  or |MeepEnergyRegion| (or other specialized subregion class) depending on the functional objective we have in mind.

               2. Then we would pass this object as a parameter to an API method like `Simulation.add_flux` 
                  or `Simulation.add_energy` to request computation of frequency-domain Poynting fluxes or energy densities
                  for the given region.


           `meep_adjoint` simplifies this by **(a)** collapsing all of the distinct
           data structures for physical subregions in step 1 to the single class `Subregion`, and
           **(b)** eliminating step 2. Thus, the *only* thing you need to do to declare
           your interest in frequency-domain fields in a given region of the computational cell 
           is to create a `Subregion` and add it to the list passed as the `objective_regions`
           parameter to the `OptimizationProblem` constructor.

           For the router problem, the frequency-domain quantities
           we want are just the fluxes into or out of each port,
           so we create codimension-1 `Subregions` for each of the 
           waveguide stubs::

                #----------------------------------------------------------------------
                #- objective regions
                #----------------------------------------------------------------------
                n_center   = ORIGIN + d_flux*YHAT
                s_center   = ORIGIN - d_flux*YHAT
                e_center   = ORIGIN + d_flux*XHAT
                w1_center  = ORIGIN - d_flux*XHAT
                w2_center  = w1_center - (l_stub/3.0)*XHAT

                north      = Subregion(center=n_center,  size=2.0*w_north*XHAT, dir=mp.Y,  name='north')
                south      = Subregion(center=s_center,  size=2.0*w_south*XHAT, dir=mp.Y,  name='south')
                east       = Subregion(center=e_center,  size=2.0*w_east*YHAT,  dir=mp.X,  name='east')
                west1      = Subregion(center=w1_center, size=2.0*w_west*YHAT,  dir=mp.X,  name='west1')
                west2      = Subregion(center=w2_center, size=2.0*w_west*YHAT,  dir=mp.X,  name='west2')

                objective_regions = [north, south, east, west1, west2]
                                   


        3. `design_region`: *Informing `meep_adjoint` where it is allowed to vary the permittivity*


           As noted above, we don't need to create any `GeometricObjects`
           for the tweakable region of the device geometry, but we **do** need
           to define the bounding box of this region via the `Subregion`-valued 
           constructor parameter `design_region`. For the router geometry, 
           the design region is a square of side length `l_design` centered
           at the origin::


             #----------------------------------------------------------------------
             #- design region
             #----------------------------------------------------------------------
             design_center = ORIGIN
             design_size   = [l_design, l_design, h]
             design_region = Subregion(name='design', center=design_center, size=design_size)

    
           .. admonition:: `design_region` is a convenience shortcut for `basis`

               Just as `source_region` is a convenience shortcut for the more general
               `sources`, `design_region` is a convenience shortcut for the more general
               `basis` parameter to the `OptimizationProblem` constructor. If `design_region`
               is specified, it is used together with the `meep_adjoint` configuration
               options `element_type` and `element_length` to construct a
               :class:`FiniteElementBasis` for the given region with elements of the
               given type and length. If you have a non-rectangular design region and/or 
               non-finite-element basis set, just instantiate your own instance of `Basis`
               and pass it as the `basis` parameter to the `OptimizationProblem` constructor.


        4. `extra_regions`: Additional subregions not covered by the above

            In some cases you may want to specify additional subregions of the
            computational cell, not covered by any of the above categories,
            for which to request computation of frequency-domain fields.
            The optional `extra_regions` parameter may be used to pass a list
            of such regions. (**API Note:** This is technically superfluous, as
            extra subregions could just be tacked on to the `objective_regions`
            list, but maybe retaining `extra_regions` will make codes easier to 
            read and understand?)



.. _defining_the_objective_function:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1D. Define the objective function
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The last item to specify is the objective function that we are trying to maximize. This is just
a character string, passed as the `f_obj` parameter to the `OptimizationProblem` constructor,
defining a mathematical function in which one or more 
:ref:`objective quantities <objective_quantities>` appear as variables. [#f4]_
(As discussed 
:ref:`here <objective_quantities>`, objective quantities have canonical names like
`S_North` or `UE_Box` formed by pairing a physical-quantity code--such as `S` for Poynting flux or
`UE` for electric-field energy---with the name of a subregion as specified by the `--name` 
parameter to the :class:`Subregion <meep_adjoint.dft_cell.Subregion>` constructor.)

For the right-angle router, our goal is simply to maximize power outflux through the **North**
waveguide port, so we could take the objective function to be just the Poynting flux 
(:ref:`objective quantity code<ObjectiveQuantityCodes>`: `S`) measured
at the objective region we named **North**, i.e.::


    fobj_router = 'S_North'


This is about as simple as an objective function can possibly get, and attempts at automated
optimization with this objective do in fact produce somewhat improved designs. However, as
it happens, there is an alternative way to define an objective function  for this problem
that yields *significantly* better final outcomes: instead of optimizing for maximal power
outflux, we optimize for maximal overlap with the forward-traveling eigenmode of the
**North** waveguide, taking the objective function to be the 
squared modulus of the eigenmode expansion coefficient for forward-traveling mode 1
(:ref:`objective quantity code<ObjectiveQuantityCodes>`: `P1` or `F1`)::


    fobj_router = '|P1_North|^2'


So these are the objective functions to choose if we want our optimized design
to be a right-angle router. On the other hand, if instead we want a three-way
symmetric *splitter* with maximal equality of output power from north, south,
and east, then we need an objective function that penalizes discrepancies
in outgoing flux---something like::


    fobj_splitter = '-( S_north - S_east )^2  -( S_east - S_south )^2 - (S_south - S_north)^2 

or::

    fobj_splitter = '-( |P1_north| - |P1_east| )^2  -( |P1_east| - |M1_south| )^2 -(|M1_south| - |P1_north|)^2'


In `router.py` we select one or another of these objective functions depending on
command-line arguments::


    objective_function = fobj_splitter if args.splitter else fobj_router


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1E. Instantiate the `OptimizationProblem`
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The final step is to invoke the `OptimizationProblem` constructor with the various
parameter values initialized above. In `router.py` this is done at the end of the `init_problem`
routine, which returns the new class instance::

    return OptimizationProblem(
     cell_size=cell_size,
     background_geometry=background_geometry,
     source_region=source_region,
     objective_regions=objective_regions,
     design_region=design_region,
     extra_regions=[full_region]
     objective_problem=objective,
     extra_quantities=extra_quantities
    )





.. _Phase2:

==================================================
Phase 2: Interactive exploration
==================================================
As discussed above, the goals of the interactive phase are

    + to sanity-check our work in the previous phase
      by investigating the `OptimizationProblem` we constructed
      and confirming that it correctly describes the design problem
      we want to solve, and

    + to get a sense of the computational cost of evaluating the
      objective function and the practical feasibility of achieving 
      our desired performance targets, which will help us in the
      following phase to make reasonable choices for various parameters
      controlling the automated design iteration.


We begin the interactive phase by invoking the `init_problem`
routine in the `router.py` script, which executes the initialization
procedure detailed above and returns a new instance of 
:class:`OptimizationProblem <meep_adjoint.OptimizationProblem>`::

    >>> import router
    >>> prob = router.init_problem()

Now our python session contains a new
:class:`OptimizationProblem <meep_adjoint:OptimizationProblem>` named `prob`.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2A. Visualizing the geometry
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The most basic sanity check is to inspect a graphical visualization
of the problem geometry to make sure the problem we specified is the
one we wanted. For this purpose, the `meep_adjoint` package contains
a built-in :doc:`visualization module <../visualization/index>` that
reduces the task of visualizing a geometry to a one-liner::

   >>> prob.visualize()


This should produce an image like the following:

.. image:: RouterGeometry0.png


This 

    .. admonition:: Customizing the visualization

        .. code-block:: python

            prob.visualize()


----------------------------------------------------------------------
2B. Updating the design function
----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   prob.update_design(design='2 + cos(3*x)*sin(2*y)')
   prob.visualize()


----------------------------------------------------------------------
2C. Compute objective function value and gradient   
----------------------------------------------------------------------


.. code-block:: python

   fq, _ = prob(need_gradient = False)


.. code-block:: python

   _ , gradf = prob(need_value = False)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2D. Displace design variables in direction of gradient and check that objective function improves
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


.. _Phase3:
==================================================
Phase 3: Automated optimization
==================================================


.. [#f1] To clarify, these are the sources for the *forward* simulation; sources for the *adjoint* simulation are determined automatically within :obj:`meep_adjoint`.

.. [#f2] More specifically, the following configuration options
         are referenced: `fcen`, `df`, `source_mode`, and `source_component`.

         If `source_mode>=1`, the source is an |MeepEigenmodeSource|
         for the eigenmode of the given index; in this case the 
         `source_component` option is not referenced.

         Otherwise (i.e. `source_mode==0`), the source is an ordinary
         |MeepSource| with component determined by the value of
         `source_component` (which should be a string like ``Ex`` or ``Hy``).

.. [#f3] Specifically, eigenmode sources---or volume sources with spatially
         uniform amplitude---lying within a single `SubRegion` and having
         Gaussian temporal envelope.

.. [#f4] It is perfectly legal to define objective functions that don't
         depend on any objective quantities, but then the objective-function
         value would be independent of the design variables and the optimization
         problem would be trivial.
